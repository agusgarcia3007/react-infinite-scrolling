# Rick and Morty Infinite Scrolling

This project uses the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to display an infinite scrolling list of characters from the show. The list is fetched and paginated using [React Query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/), a popular library for data fetching and caching in React applications.

## Features

- Display a paginated list of characters from the Rick and Morty show
- Implement infinite scrolling to fetch additional characters as the user scrolls down the page
- Fetch data with a custom hook
